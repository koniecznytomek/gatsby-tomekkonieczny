desc: SosoSocks is one of those brands that cannot be ignored despite the fact that you can buy socks everywhere. The main task of this project was the creation and development of an entirely fully responsive e-commerce platform.
short: It is very pleasant when you can use your favorite technology stack for some new project.
  This was also the case with Soso brand. Using the great static page generator, which is Gatsby and Snipcart as backend
  store system, I created a lightweight and blazing fast webpage.
